# Plunge-into-Protection
An arcade game being developed while learning the Godot 4 engine.

This project is a clone of the Mario Bros game (with some parts from Mario Bros. Special from Sharp X1). There are no strict guidelines, I am simply learning the Godot engine. It is my first project, so there is a slight disorganization, especially with regards to file structure and naming conventions for variables/nodes. The GDScript scripts are created based on Java's class structure.
