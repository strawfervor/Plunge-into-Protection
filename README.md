# Plunge-into-Protection
An arcade game being developed while learning the Godot 4 engine.

This project is a clone (more or less acurate) of the Mario Bros game. There are no strict guidelines, I am simply learning the Godot engine. It is my first project, so there is a slight disorganization, especially with regards to file structure and naming conventions for variables/nodes.

## Builds available on itch:

## Controls
Arrow keys/a d - move Space/z  - jump 

## Fancy description:
Plunge into Protection is a retro arcade game where you take on the role of a heroic plumber, fighting back against creatures that have polluted the city's waterways. Armed with nothing but your trusty head, you must knock these creatures off the... place where they are.

You have certainly never encountered such unique gameplay!

The game is under active development.
